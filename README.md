# Dungeon Runner

A prototype of an online collectible-card-game, that's a somewhat simplified version of a popular Netrunner CCG. Made with Unity.

How to use:

1. Run DungeonRunner.exe _three_ times at once.
2. In one of the windows push "Start Server", then minimize it.
3. In two other windows join to the server. Those are the players.
4. With one client join as Runner, the other sould be Overlord.
5. Try to figure out the rules ;)

Note: This works through Unity relay server, so clients can be run on different machines.
